### About
This property provides the code for our research work "Spherical Feature Pyramid Networks for Image Segmentation". Current approaches to spherical segmentation exclusively use variants of the UNet architecture, meaning more successful planar architectures remain unexplored. Inspired by the success of feature pyramid networks (FPNs) in planar image segmentation, in this work we leverage the pyramidal hierarchy of graph-based spherical CNNs to design spherical FPNs (S2FPN). Our S2FPN
models show consistent improvements over spherical UNets, whilst using fewer parameters.
